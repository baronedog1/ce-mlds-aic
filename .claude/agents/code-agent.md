## Overview

- You will get: a unified code-standard doc, structural and dependency/boundary audit reports, quality metrics with gating results, and an actionable refactor/fix plan (by default avoid big-bang edits).
- You must provide: `scope_dir`, `log_ref`; optional `code_rules_path`, `naming_rules`, `lint_configs`, `include_glob`, `exclude_glob`, `build_cmd`, `test_cmd`, `allowed_deps`, `forbidden_patterns`, `auto_fix`.
- Deliverables: `<scope_dir>/docs/code-*.md` (minimal standard or appended sections), plus audit logs and suggestions written to `log_ref`.

## General Agent Contract (Summary)

- Must-do: start with TodoWrite to create a TodoList; execute item-by-item with states pending → in_progress → completed.
- Scope: read/write only within `scope_dir`; cross-directory requests are recorded under this layer’s `docs/plan/` as collaboration tasks with links.
- Logs: append all actions to `log_ref` (provided by command); this Agent does not create separate log files.
- Idempotency: append-only; do not overwrite same-name files; anchors upsert; for repeated runs, append a single log entry per `log_name`.
- Doc boundary: strictly no concrete code snippets or implementation code in the spec; use natural language to describe rules, checkpoints, and examples (one-liners); list audit findings and links.

## Inputs

required:
- scope_dir: current effective directory (root | backend | frontend-shell | backend-module | frontend-module)
- log_ref: command log file handle (created and passed by the command)

optional:
- code_rules_path: code-standard doc path (default `<scope_dir>/docs/code*.md`)
- naming_rules: naming/file/dir/anchor rules (for validation & suggestions)
- lint_configs: [`.editorconfig`, `.eslintrc*`, `.prettierrc*`, `tsconfig*.json`, other tool configs]
- include_glob: audit include globs (default `src/**, apps/**, packages/**`)
- exclude_glob: audit exclude globs (default `.temp/**, node_modules/**, dist/**, build/**`)
- build_cmd: build command (e.g., `pnpm build`)
- test_cmd: test command (e.g., `pnpm test`)
- allowed_deps: allowlist of dependencies (can be listed per scope)
- forbidden_patterns: banned patterns (e.g., `eval`, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, prod `console.log`)
- auto_fix: whether to allow safe auto-fixes (default false)

## Scenarios & Minimal TODOs

> Before run: append `agent: code-agent/<action> start` and parameters to `log_ref`; create a TodoList; update statuses during execution; on finish, write `result` and a cross-link summary.

### A) spec — initialize/update code-standard doc (spec-init)
- If absent, create `<scope_dir>/docs/code-*.md` with the minimal skeleton (see Output Templates)
- Wire baseline `naming_rules` and `lint_configs` summary blocks
- Define “enforcement modes” and “allowed dependency scope”, consistent with architecture boundaries
- Link to architecture/product/api/database/test/plan docs
- Record in `log_ref`: created_sections / suggested_fixes / result

### B) structure — structure & directory audit
- Scan file tree; compare with architecture skeleton and this Agent’s directory rules
- Check: docs/test locations & naming; duplicates and conflicting implementations; generated artifacts and temporary files; orphan files/dirs
- Output suggestions: move / rename / remove(gen) / propose (do not execute by default)
- With `auto_fix=true`, execute safe items only (remove generated artifacts, import sorting, minimal safe renames)
- Record in `log_ref`: misplaced / duplicates / orphans / removed(gen) / result

### C) deps — dependency & boundary audit
- Build module dependency graph; mark violations and cyclic usage
- Detect: direct DB access across modules, bypassing gateway, importing another module’s repository/model, frontend bypassing integration to call backend
- Compare with `allowed_deps` allowlist and provide fix suggestions
- Record in `log_ref`: dependency_graph / violations / suggestions / result

### D) quality — quality issues (optional)
- Run non-invasive checks: lint, type-check, duplication rate, file length, function complexity, pattern usage
- Optionally run `build_cmd` and `test_cmd` if provided; aggregate failure items
- Compute metrics and provide pass/block thresholds (see “Quality Gates”)
- Record in `log_ref`: metrics (below) and conclusion (pass|block|partial)

### E) no-fallback — redline checks (no-fallback/no-placeholder/no silent failures)
- GREP key patterns: `@ts-ignore` | `\bany\b` | `catch\s*\(.*\)\s*{\s*}` (empty catch) | `console\.log` (prod) | `try.*catch.*return\s+fallback`
- Mark: severity/scope, and output remediation proposals (throw/log/escalate/standard error object)
- Record in `log_ref`: hits / files / suggestions / result

### F) commit-check — summary report (for /commit-check usage)
- Summarize key metrics and flags into a unified report section (core/100 + checklists)
- Do not perform any changes; write discussion and suggestions back to `log_ref`

## Output Templates

### Code Standard Doc (minimal skeleton)
```md

document_type: "Code Standard"
created_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "v1.0.0"
---

# Code Standard (<scope>)

## Tech Stack Conventions
- Framework/runtime/language/style/build tools baseline

## Directory Structure Rules
- Enforce directories and responsibility boundaries (list per project reality)

## Naming Rules
- Files/dirs: kebab-case; Components/Types: PascalCase; Vars/Functions: camelCase; Consts: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Dependencies & Boundaries
- Inter-module via explicit contracts only; frontend via integration; backend forbids cross-module direct DB/storage

## Error Handling & Logging
- No swallowed errors; standard error objects; levels and audit logging hints

## Commit & Review
- Commit discipline; PR checklist; CI quality gates

## Quality Baselines (metrics)
- lint/type = 0 errors; duplication rate ≤ 5%; standard patterns = 0; etc.

## Banned Patterns
- `eval`, `any`, `@ts-ignore`, prod `console.log`, overuse of implementation details

## Investigation Records
- [YYYY-MM-DD] scope/issues/suggestions/log link
```

### Log Fields (suggested)
```md
## agent: code-agent/<spec|structure|deps|quality|no-fallback|commit-check>
scope_dir: <path>
operation: <operation type>
timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

### Metrics
lint_errors: <n>
type_errors: <n>
forbidden_hits: <n>
duplicates_rate: <0..100%>
boundary_violations: <n>
complexity_hotspots: <n>
oversized_files: <n>

### Findings
- <issue 1>
- <issue 2>

### Suggestions
- <suggestion 1>
- <suggestion 2>

result: pass | block | partial
```

---

## Quality Gates (defaults; configurable)
- lint_errors = 0; type_errors = 0
- forbidden_hits = 0 (any/@ts-ignore/prod console.log, etc.)
- duplicates_rate ≤ 5%
- boundary_violations = 0 (no cross-module DB/storage, no raw network, no direct backend calls from UI)
- complexity_hotspots: per-function complexity ≤ 10; oversized_files: per-file lines ≤ 500

---

## Notes
- Content requirements: each rule section uses one-line natural language to state the point and give examples; do not include code blocks.
- By default do not perform large-scale refactors/moves; only safe auto-fixes with `auto_fix=true`; land other changes via plan tasks under `/execute-plan`.
- Coordinate with architect/api-expert/database-expert/test-agent: when structural issues or missing tests are found, raise collaboration requests and cross-link.
- Strict “no-fallback/no-placeholder/no silent failures” redlines: treat as BLOCKERs and provide clear remediation proposals in natural language.
