## Overview

- You will get: normalized plan docs (`docs/plan/plan-*.md`), high-quality task cards, bidirectional links with product/api/database/integration/data-ui/test, and statuses with evidence.
- You must provide: `scope_dir`, `log_ref`; optional `plan_path`, `task_anchor`, `seed_requirements`, `doc_paths` ({product, api, database, test, integration, data_ui}).
- Deliverables: plan docs and task cards; parent/child plan links (if any); key checks and consistency logs in `log_ref`.

## General Agent Contract (Summary)

- Must-do: start with TodoWrite to create a TodoList; execute item-by-item (pending → in_progress → completed).
- Scope: read/write within `scope_dir` only; cross-directory requests must be registered under this layer’s `docs/plan/` with links.
- Logs: write all actions to `log_ref`; this Agent does not create separate logs.
- Idempotency: append-only; do not overwrite same-name files; anchors upsert; task cards are keyed by anchors.
- Doc boundary: do not write implementation code; plan describes goals/paths/DoD/evidence/cross-links and statuses only.

## Inputs

required:
- scope_dir: root | backend | frontend-shell | backend-module | frontend-module
- log_ref: command log handle

optional:
- plan_path: plan doc path (default `<scope_dir>/docs/plan/plan*.md`; supports child plans)
- task_anchor: target task anchor (e.g., `#task-export`) for modify scenarios
- seed_requirements: raw requirements/discussion points/prototype links (for seeding)
- doc_paths: {product, api, database, test, integration, data_ui} relative paths (if omitted, resolve by rule)

## Scenarios & Minimal TODOs

> Before run: append `agent: task-planner/<action> start` and parameters to `log_ref`; create a TodoList; update statuses; on finish, write `result` and a cross-link summary.

### A) create — generate plan and task cards
- If `plan_path` missing: create minimal header and “Task List” + “Change Records” sections
- Analyze: read seed and related docs (backend: product/api/database/test; frontend: product-ui/integration/data-ui/test)
- Synthesize: define task cards with 8 essentials (see Task Card template) and create anchor `#task-<kebab>`
- Related docs: list required links on each card (product/api/database or integration/data-ui, plus test)
- Bidirectional links: create unit tests and link back from test docs to plan task anchors
- Verify: anchors unique and reachable; do not add “pending classification” items
- Record: anchors.created / anchors.referenced / checks / result

### B) modify — modify a task (implementation path / doc links / DoD)
- Locate: find the card by `task_anchor`; compare current implementation plan and DoD
- Update: split steps per “reproducible checklist”; keep anchors stable
- Sync: update corresponding test items; enforce bidirectional links
- Record: write diff and result to `log_ref`

### C) update — update task status or add evidence
- Status: pending | in_progress | done | blocked
- Evidence: log links / PR / screenshots; backfill to the card’s “Implementation Records” and to test case “Execution Records”
- Issues: append “Issue Records” and “Collaboration Requests” (record link only under cross-directory)

### D) validate — consistency checks
- Paths: plan ↔ product/api/database (or integration/data-ui) ↔ test bidirectional reachability
- Anchors: `#task-<kebab>` on plan matches corresponding anchors in related docs
- Output: list broken links/duplicates with remediation suggestions

### E) link-children — link parent/child plans (optional)
- Split large tasks into child plans (`plan-<task-kebab>-partN.md`)
- In the parent plan: add a child plan index; in each child plan header: add `parent_plan`
- Do not write implementation details here; use `/split-plan` to guide split and land links/anchors only

## Output Templates

### Plan Doc — `docs/plan/plan-<scope>.md`
```md

document_type: "Task Plan"
created_date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
version: "v1.0.0"

# Plan (<scope>)
Meta:
- Parent Plan: <file.md#task-... | N/A>
- Children Plans: <[... ] | N/A>

## Task List
<!-- Add task cards by the template below -->

## Change Records
- [YYYY-MM-DD] <summary> · Log: ./logs/plan-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md
```

### Task Card — 8 essentials
```md
### - [ ] <Task Name> · task-<kebab> · Goal: <one sentence>
Source: <seed/discussion/requirement link>
Related Docs: [product#feature-x] [api#api-x] [database#table-x] / [integration#api-x] [data-ui#vm-x] [test#test-x]
Implementation Path: <step1/step2/... (may link)>
DoD: <verifiable definition>
Evidence: <logs/PR/screenshots>
Status: pending | in_progress | done | blocked

Implementation Records:
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Start · touched: [..]
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Done  · Log: ./logs/execute-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md

Issue Records:
- [YYYY-MM-DD] <issue> · Impact: <scope> · Status: open/closed
```

### Collaboration Request (cross-directory)
```md
## Collaboration Request
### Need <target directory> cooperation
- Task: <specific item>
- Link: [<target> plan doc](relative/path)
- Notes: <details and rationale>
- Priority: high/medium/low
- Status: pending/processing/done
```

### Parent/Child Plan Links Section
```md
- [ ] <Original Parent Task> (split)
  - Child Plans:
    - [Part 1](plan-<task>-part1.md)
    - [Part 2](plan-<task>-part2.md)
  - Status: pending execution of child plans
```

## Log Fields (suggested)
```md
## agent: task-planner/<create|modify|update|validate|link-children>
scope_dir: <path>
operation: <operation type>
timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

anchors:
  created: [#task-a, #task-b]
  referenced: [product#feature-x, api#api-y, ...]
checks:
  reachable: <n>
  unreachable: [<anchors>]

result: success | partial | fail
notes: <guardrails/follow-ups>
```

---

## Naming & Cross-link Rules
- Directory: always use `docs/plan/`; files `plan-<scope>.md`.
- Anchors: `#task-<kebab>`; in related docs: `#feature-<kebab>` `#api-<kebab>` `#table-<snake>` `#page-<kebab>` `#vm-<kebab>` `#test-<kebab>`
- Bidirectional: plan tasks ↔ test cases must be linked; related spec links must be reachable and consistent.

---

## Heuristics
- Outcome-oriented: each task must have verifiable artifacts (docs edits/checklists, code changes, tests, evidence)
- Decompose by capability: function/flow/entity/interface granularity; avoid conflating controller/service/repository layers
- Align with product docs: one feature ↔ one task; one page ↔ one task; emphasize cross-links and evidence
- After completion: update product doc fields “implementation status” for related features/pages
- For tasks > 2 days or spanning modules: use `/split-plan` to create child plans
